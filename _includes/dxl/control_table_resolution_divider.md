It allows the user to change Dynamixelâ€™s resolution.
The default Resolution Divider Value is set as 1. (1 ~ 4 available)
When resolution is lowered, revolutions (in both directions) can be increased (up to 28 turns in each direction).
Present Position = Real Position / Resolution Divider
For example, a Real Position of 2048 with a Resolution Divider set as 2 will yield a Present Position value of 1024 (2048/2 = 1024). A Dynamixel with Resolution Divider set as 2 will have a resolution 2048 for a single revolution.
The Present Position can be obtained while Multi-turn Offset and Resolution Divider are taken into account.
Present position = (Real Position / Resolution Divider) + Multi-turn Offset
For example, a Dynamixel with a Real Position of 2048 with a Resolution Divider set as 4 and Multi-turn Offset as 1024 will yield a Present Position of 1535 ((2048/4) + 1024 = 1535).
