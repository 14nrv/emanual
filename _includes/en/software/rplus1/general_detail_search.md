##### General Search
- Search for Dynamixels connected at 1Mbps.
- Search speed is fast because it searches for only Dynamixels connected at 1Mbps.
- Dynamixels connected at other speeds are not found.  
 
##### Detailed Search
- Search for Dynamixels connected at every possible communication speed.
- Search speed is slower because it searches for Dynamixels connected at different communication speeds.
- The Dynamixel that are not connected at 1Mbps are automatically adjusted to 1Mbps.  
 
**NOTE** : If a Dynamixel is no longer detected after a detailed search, there might be an ID duplication. In this case, connect only the undetected device, and change its ID to an unused one. (Refer to the [Change ID of Dynamixel].)
