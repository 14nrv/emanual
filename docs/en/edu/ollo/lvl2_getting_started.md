# [Introduction](#introduction)
Create robots using the controllers and sensors.
Through 12-session curriculum, learn scientific principle and physics theory such as power of robot, usage of sensors, speed and force, walking, and running etc. by experiment.

`Note` For OLLO Explorer, the instructor will download the program.  If you want to download and learn the program for yourself, you must purchase [USB Downloader(LN-101)][ln-101] separately. If you want to build and program your robots using more peripheral devices, please purchase OLLO [Inventor][inventor].
