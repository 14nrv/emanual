# [Introduction](#introduction)

ROBOTIS PLAY 700 OLLOBOT is a reconfigurable and programmable robotics kit that introduces children to STEAM Concepts.  
Building upon the PLAY 600 PETs, the PLAY 700 emphasizes creative design using ROBOTIS' patented rivet system and adds two elements: programming and smart device connectivity.  
The controller included with the PLAY 700, the CM-50 is a motorized gearbox that brings your child's creation to live. It also includes built-in sensors so that children can learn programming via SCRATCH or ROBOTIS R+TASK.
