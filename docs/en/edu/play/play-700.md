# [Introduction](#introduction)

ROBOTIS PLAY 700 OLLOBOT is a reconfigurable and programmable robotics kit that introduces children to STEAM Concepts.  
Building upon the PLAY 600 PETs, the PLAY 700 emphasizes creative design using ROBOTIS' patented rivet system and adds two elements: programming and smart device connectivity.  
The controller included with the PLAY 700, the CM-50 is a motorized gearbox that brings your child's creation to live. It also includes built-in sensors so that children can learn programming via [SCRATCH]{: .blank} or ROBOTIS [R+TASK]{: .blank}.

## [Windows PC](#windows-pc)
In order to learn how to program a robot using Scratch, please install required softwares.

**WARNING** : [BT-410] requires [BT-410 Dongle] to connect to a PC.
{: .notice--warning}

**NOTE** : [BT-410 Dongle] can be purchased separately. Please visit [ROBOTIS Shop](http://www.robotis.us/bt-410-dongle/#)
{: .notice}

### [Software Install](#software-install)

Scratch adopts block programming GUI that is easier than traditional programming style.  
It is recommended to use Scratch to program the robot.  

- [R+SCRATCH](http://en.robotis.com/service/download.php?no=9%20) Download
- [SCRATCH 2.0 Offline Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/download) Download

### [Connect Bluetooth](#connect-bluetooth)  

In order to control sensors and motors from Scratch program, CM-50 controller should be connected to Scratch via R+Scratch.  

![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_bt410topc.png)

Connect [BT-410 Dongle] to the USB port on the PC.  
After finishing assembly of a robot, turn on the controller's power.  
By taking [BT-410] module close to the [BT-410 Dongle], they'll automatically be paired.  
Succesful pairing will turn on the solid blue LED for both [BT-410] and Dongle modules.  

### [Run Scratch](#run-scratch)

1. Run the R+Scratch program. Select `CM-50` on the controller menu.  
  ![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_a_scratch.png)

2. Click on Port tap and then `Auto Search` to find the port connected to controller automatically.  
  ![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_b_scratch.png)

  ![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_c_scratch.png)

4. Click on `Open Scratch` to open saved Scratch program. In order to write a new program, click on `New Scratch`.  
  ![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_d_scratch.png)  

5. Double click on the program to run. After saving, Scratch will run.  
  ![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_e_scratch.png)

6. On the Scratch program, click on `More Block` to find out available blocks for CM-50 controller.  
There are blocks for controlling motors and sensors in the CM-50 controller.   
Green dot indicates the robot is connected to the program.

# [Reference](#reference)

## [Access to Play Mode](#access-to-play-mode)  

It's a mode for robot to play downloaded tasks. Briefly press the power button on controller(CM-50) to enter Play Mode.

## [Access to Manage Mode](#access-to-manage-mode)  

When the controller(CM-50) is powered off, press long a power button of controller(CM-50) without any obstacle blocking IR sensor until 2 times short beep sounds in a row. 

## [Access to Tuning Mode](#access-to-tuning-mode)  

There are 2 method about entering Tuning Mode. Choose your preference.
 
### [First Method](#firtst-method)

1. On the top side of the controller which has the power button, there is two IR sensors. Put white color item on the sensors from 1 cm (0.39 inch) distance. Make sure CM-50 should be powered off.

2. Press the button for 2 seconds then it sounds 2 times short beep sound in a row. Some melody would be played if it enters Tuning Mode

**CAUTION** : If the melody isn't played right after beep sounds, it enters Manage Mode. Push the power button to turn controller off and start again.
{: .notice--warning}

**CAUTION** : If BT Slave is connected to controller(CM-50) before power controller on, please separate them from controller. Otherwise it dosen't enter appropriate mode. 
{: .notice--warning} 


### [Second Method](#second-method)

1. While controller(CM-50) is powered on, press long the power button of controller(CM-50) untill 3 times long beep sounds in a row then a melody is played. 

**CAUTION** : During the beep sounds, keep pushing the button strongly enough. Otherwise it might have a chance to be turned off.  
{: .notice--warning}


## [Speed Synchronization for Straightness](#speed-synchronization-for-straightness)

If your robot dosen't move straight and keep drift in right or left, the controller is required to test a speed synchronization of motors to let your robot move steady.  
Please follow the steps to tune the right and left motor speed for straightness.  

{% capture notice02 %}  
**NOTE** :  
CM-50 supports Tuning Mode on Firmware version 77 or above.  
Please update current firmware version to the latest version by R+Manager 2.0.

### [Motor Tuning](#motor-tuning)

In order to synchronize right and left wheel speed, you need to tune the motor personally with remote controller ([RC-100B](#rc-100b), [RC-200](#rc-200) or [Virtual Remote Controller](#virtual-remote-controller)).  

#### [RC-100B](#rc-100b)

1. Prepare BT-210 or BT-410 Master/Slave Module.
2. [Access to Tuning Mode](#access-to-tuning-mode)
3. Connect the BT-210 or 410 Slave onto controller(CM-50).  
4. Connect the BT-210 or 410 Master to RC-100B.
5. Tune the motor speed  - [Remote Controller Description](#remote-controller-description)

  
#### [RC-200](#rc-200)

RC-200 supports IR communication with controller.  

Set the communication channel to send appropriate signals then tune motors.
