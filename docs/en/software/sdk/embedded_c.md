# [Introduction](#introduction)

It makes the users possible to develop their own firmware. The characteristics are as follows:
- All the sources are written in C Language.
- The examples of how to control each part of the controller directly are provided.

`Note` If you want to use Embedded C, you need the knowledge of software and hardware. If you are a beginner, we recommend you use Embedded C after learing the software and the hardware.
{: .notice}

`Note` If you use Embedded C, you cannot use RoboPlus since the controller's firmware is changed. If you want to use RoboPlus again, you must restore the firmware using RoboPlus.
