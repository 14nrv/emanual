# [PLAY](#play)  

# **Frequently Asked Questions for ROBOTIS PLAY**  

1. **Motor does not work?**  
    Please check assembly and make sure that nothing is blocking the motor.  
    Sometimes, a spindle or other piece blocks the motor and it may seem like the motor is not working.  
    Recommend R+ Design 2.0 ([Windows]{: .blank} / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robotis.mdesign&hl=en)/ [iOS]{: .blank}) for interactive assembly.  


2. **Faulty power switch on the CM-20**   
    CM-20 is broken. Please replace the broken CM-20 with a new controller.  

3. **Battery case is difficult to open on CM-20**  
    Apply firm and evenly distributed pressure near the center of the battery cover and press outward in the direction that the arrows are pointing.
