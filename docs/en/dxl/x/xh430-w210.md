## [Performance Graph](#performance-graph)
![](/emanual/assets/images/dxl/x/xh430_w210_performance_graph.jpg)

`Note` The max torque measurement method  for the Stall Torque and Performance Graph is different. Stall torque is measured from the max torque that it can reach. This is generally how RC servos measure their torque. For the Performance graph with the N-T curves, it is measured with the load gradually increasing. The motor operation environment is closer to the performance graph, not stall torque method. This is probably why the performance graph is being broadly used in the industrial market. This is why the max torque of the performance grap can actually be less than the stall torque.
{: .notice}

`Warning` When connecting to power supply, it is recommended using ROBOTIS controller or SMPS2DYNAMIXEL.
Do not connect or disconnect DYNAMIXEL when power is being supplied.
{: .notice--warning}

# [Control Table](#control-table)
The Control Table is a structure of data implemented in the DYNAMIXEL. Users can read a specific Data to get status of the DYNAMIXEL with Read Instruction Packets, and modify Data as well to control DYNAMIXEL with WRITE Instruction Packets.

## [Control Table, Data, Address](#control-table-data-address)
The Control Table is a structure that consists of multiple Data fields to store status of the DYNAMIXEL or to control the DYNAMIXEL. Users can check current status of the DYNAMIXEL by reading a specific Data from the Control Table with Read Instruction Packets. WRITE Instruction Packets enable users to control the DYNAMIXEL by changing specific Data in the Control Table. The Address is a unique value when accessing a specific Data in the Control Table with Instruction Packets. In order to read or write data, users must designate a specific Address in the Instruction Packet. Please refer to [Protocol] for more details about Instruction Packets.

`Note` Two's complement is applied for the negative value. For more information, please refer to [Two's complement] from Wikipedia.
{: .notice}

### [Area (EEPROM, RAM)](#area-eeprom-ram)
The Control Table is divided into 2 Areas. Data in the RAM Area is reset to initial values when the DYNAMIXEL is turned on (Volatile). On the other hand, modified data in the EEPROM Area keeps their values even when the DYNAMIXEL is turned off (Non-Volatile). Data in the EEPROM Area can only be changed when the value of Torque Enable(64) is cleared to ‘0’.

### [Size](#size)
The Size of data varies from 1 to 4 bytes depend on their usage. Please check the size of data when updating the data with an Instruction Packet.

### [Access](#access)
The Control Table has two different access properties. ‘RW’ property stands for read and write access permission while ‘R’ stands for read only access permission. Data with the read only property cannot be changed by the WRITE Instruction. Read only property(‘R’) is generally used for measuring and monitoring purpose, and read write property(‘RW’) is used for controlling DYNAMIXEL.

### [Initial Value](#initial-value)
Each data in the Control Table is restored to initial values when the DYNAMIXEL is turned on. Default values in the EEPROM area are initial values of the DYNAMIXEL (factory default settings). If any values in the EEPROM area are modified by a user, modified values will be restored as initial values when the DYNAMIXEL is turned on. Initial Values in the RAM area are restored when the DYNAMIXEL is turned on.

## [Control Table Description](#control-table-description)

### <a name="model-number"></a>**Model Number (0)**
 This address stores model number of the DYNAMIXEL.

### <a name="firmware-version"></a>**Firmware Version (6)**
 This address stores firmware version of the DYNAMIXEL.

### <a name="id"></a>**ID (7)**
 The ID is a unique value in the network to identify each DYNAMIXEL with an Instruction Packet.
 0~252 (0xFC) values can be used as an ID, and 254(0xFE) is occupied as a broadcast ID. The Broadcast ID(254, 0xFE) can send an Instruction Packet to all connected DYNAMIXELs simultaneously.

 `Note` Please avoid using an identical ID for multiple DYNAMIXELs. In order to change the ID in the EEPROM Area, Torque Enable(64) has to be cleared to ‘0’ in advance.
 {: .notice}


### <a name="baud-rate"></a>**Baud Rate (8)**
 Baud Rate determines serial communication speed between a controller and DYNAMIXELs.

| Value     | Baud Rate     | Margin of Error     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
|0|9,600|0.000%|
|1(Default)|57,600|0.000%|
| 2|115,200| 0.000%|
| 3| 1M| 0.000%|
| 4| 2M| 0.000%|
| 5| 3M| 0.000%|
| 6| 4M| 0.000%|
| 7| 4.5M| 0.000%|

`Note` Less than 3% of the baud rate error margin will not affect to UART communication.
{: .notice}


### <a name="return-delay-time"></a>**Return Delay Time (9)**
 After the DYNAMIXEL receives an Instruction Packet, it delays transmitting the Status Packet for Return Delay Time (9). For instance, if the Return Delay Time(9) is set to ‘10’, the Status Packet will be returned after 20[μsec] when the Instruction Packet is received.


 |      | Value     | Description     |
 | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
 |Unit| 2[μsec] | - |
 |Range| 0 ~ 254  | Default value ‘250’(500[μsec]), Maximum 508[μsec]|


### <a name="drive-mode"></a>**Drive Mode (10, Available after Firmware version 38)**


||     | Definition     | Values     |

|Bit 1|0x02|Rotation Direction| Normal Mode('0') : CCW(Positive), CW(Negative)|
|Bit 0|0x01|Rotation Direction| Reverse Mode('1') : CCW(Negative), CW(Positive)|

### <a name="operating-mode"></a>**Operating Mode (11)**

|Value|Operating Mode| Description     |
| :---- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| 0 | Current Control Mode | DYNAMIXEL only controls current(torque) regardless of speed and position. This mode is ideal for a gripper or a system that only uses current(torque) control or a system that has additional velocity/position controllers. |
| 1 | Velocity Control Mode(0&deg; ~ 360&deg;) | This mode controls velocity. This mode is identical to the Wheel Mode(endless) from existing DYNAMIXELs. This mode is ideal for wheel-type robots. |
| 3(Default) | Position Control Mode  |  This mode controls position. This mode is identical to the Joint Mode from existing DYNAMIXELs. Operating position range is limited by Max Position Limit(48) and Min Position Limit(52). This mode is ideal for articulated robots that each joint rotates less than 360 degrees.  |
|  4  |  Extended Position Control Mode(Multi-turn)  |  This mode controls position. This mode is identical to the Multi-Turn Mode from existing DYNAMIXELs. 512 turns are supported(-256[rev] ~ 256[rev]). This mode is ideal for multi-turn wrists or conveyer systems or a system that requires an additional reduction gear.  |
|  5  |  Current-based Position Control Mode  |  This mode controls both position and current(torque). Up to 512 turns are supported(-256[rev] ~ 256[rev]). This mode is ideal for a system that requires both position and current control such as articulated robots or grippers.  |
|  16  |  PWM Control Mode  (Voltage Control Mode)  |  This mode directly controls PWM output. (Voltage Control Mode)  |


{% capture group_notice_01 %}
`Note` Switching Operating Mode will reset gains(PID, Feedfoward) properly to the selected Operating Mode. The profile generator and limits will also be reset.
1. Profile Velocity(112), Profile Acceleration(108) : Reset to ‘0’
2. Goal PWM(100), Goal Current(102) : Reset to PWM Limit(36), Current Limit(38) respectively
3. Current-based Position Control Mode : Reset to Position Gain(PID) and PWM Limit(36) values.

Changed Position Gain(PID) and PWM Limit(36) values can be read from the Control Table.
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">
  {{ group_notice_01 | markdownify }}
</div>

`Note` PWM is the abbreviation for Pulse Width Modulation that modulates PWM Duty to control motors. The PWM Control Mode changes pulse width to control average supply voltage to the motor and this technique is widely used in the motor control field. Therefore, PWM Control Mode uses Goal PWM(100) value to control supply voltage for DYNAMIXEL. PWM Control Mode is similar to the Wheel Mode of DYNAMIXEL AX and RX series.
{: .notice}

### <a name="secondary-shadow-id"></a>**Secondary(Shadow) ID (12)**
Set the DYNAMIXEL’s Secondary ID. Secondary ID(12) is a value to identify each DYNAMIXEL, just like ID(7).
However, unlike ID(7), Secondary ID(12) is not a unique value. Therefore, DYNAMIXELs with the same Secondary ID value form a group. The differences between Secondary ID(12) and ID(7) are as follows :
1. Secondary ID(12) is not a unique value. i.e., a lot of DYNAMIXELs may have the same Secondary ID value.
2. ID(7) has a higher priority than Secondary ID(12). i.e., if Secondary ID(12) and ID(7) are the same, ID(7) will be applied first.
3. The EEPROM area of the Control Table cannot be modified with Secondary ID(12). Only the RAM area can be modified.
4. If Instruction Packet ID is the same as Secondary ID(12), the Status Packet will not be returned.
5. If the value of Secondary ID(12) is 253 or higher, the Secondary ID function is deactivated.

|      | Values     | Description     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Range       | 0 ~ 252<br />253 ~ 255       | Activate Secondary ID function<br />Deactivate Secondary ID function, Default value ‘255’ |

The following are examples of operation when there are five DYNAMIXELs with ID (7) set from 1 to 5.
1. Set all five DYNAMIXELs' Secondary ID(12) to '5'.
2. Send Write Instruction Packet(ID = 1, LED(65) = 1).
3. Turn on LED of DYNAMIXEL with ID '1' and return the Status Packet.
4. Send Write Instruction Packet(ID = 5, LED(65) = 1).
5. Turn on LED on five DYNAMIXELs. However, Status Packet of DYNAMIXEL with ID ‘5’ will be returned.
6. Set the Secondary ID(12) of all five DYNAMIXELs to ‘100’.
7. Send Write Instruction Packet(ID = 100, LED(65) = 0).
8. Turn off LED on five DYNAMIXELs. However, as there is no DYNAMIXEL with ID ‘100’, Status Packet is not returned.

### <a name="protocol-version"></a>**Protocol version (13)**
Users can select DYNAMIXEL protocol version (1.0 and 2.0). It is recommended to use an identical protocol version for multiple DYNAMIXELs.

|      | Protocol Version     |Compatible DYNAMIXELs|
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
|1|1.0| AX, DX, RX, MX, EX Series|
|2(Default)|2.0|DYNAMIXEL-X, DYNAMIXEL-PRO Series|

`Note` Protocol 2.0 is greatly improved from Protocol 1.0. Accessing some of the Control Table area might be denied if Protocol 1.0 is selected. This manual complies with Protocol 2.0. Please refer to the Protocol section of e-Manual for more details about the protocol.
{: .notice}

### <a name="homing-offset"></a>**Homing Offset (20)**
Users can adjust the Home position by setting Home Offset(20). The Homing Offset value is added to the Present Position(132).
Present Position(132) = Actual Position + Homing Offset(20).

|      | Values     | Description     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
|Unit|about 0.088&deg;|4096 resolution. All position related Data uses the same unit|
|Range|-1,044,479 ~ 1,044,479|±255[rev] range|

`Note` In case of the Position Control Mode(Joint Mode) that rotates less than 360 degrees, any invalid Homing Offset(20) values will be ignored(valid range : -1024 ~ 1024).
{: .notice}

### <a name="moving-threshold"></a>**Moving Threshold (24)**
This value helps to determine whether the DYNAMIXEL is in motion or not. When the absolute value of Present Velocity(128) is greater than the Moving Threshold(24), Moving(122) is set to ‘1’, otherwise it is cleared to ‘0’.

|      | Values     | Description     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
|Unit|about 0.229rpm;| All velocity related Data uses the same unit|
|Range|0 ~ 1,023 | - |

### <a name="temperature-limit"></a>**Temperature Limit (31)**
This value limits operating temperature. When the Present Temperature(146) that indicates internal temperature of DYNAMIXEL is greater than the Temperature Limit(31), the Over Heating Error Bit(0x04) and Hardware Error Bit(0x80) in the Hardware Error Status(70) will be set. If Overheating Error Bit(0x04) is configured in the Shutdown(63), Torque Enable(64) is cleared to ‘0’ and Torque is disabled. For more details, please refer to the Shutdown(63) section.

|      | Values     | Description     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
|Unit|about 1&deg;C|All temperature related Data uses the same unit|
|Range|0 ~ 100|-|

### <a name="max-voltage-limit"></a><a name="min-voltage-limit"></a>**Max Voltage Limit (32), Min Voltage Limit (34)**
These values are maximum and minimum operating voltages. When current input voltage acquired from Present Input Voltage(144) exceeds the range of Max Voltage Limit(32) and Min Voltage Limit(34), Voltage Range Error Bit(0x01) and Hardware Error Bit(0x80) in the Hardware Error Status(70) are set. If Input Voltage Error Bit(0x10) is configured in the Shutdown(63), Torque Enable(64) is cleared to ‘0’ and Torque is disabled. For more details, please refer to the Shutdown(63) section.

|      | Values     | Description     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
|Unit|about 0.1[V]|All voltage related Data uses the same unit|
|Range|95 ~ 160|9.5 ~ 16.0[V]|

### <a name="pwm-limit"></a>**PWM Limit (36)**
This value indicates maximum PWM output. Goal PWM(100) can’t be configured with any values exceeding PWM Limit(36). PWM Limit(36) is commonly used in all operating mode as an output limit, therefore decreasing PWM output will result in decreasing torque and velocity. For more details, please refer to the Gain section of each operating modes.

|      | Values     | Description     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
|Range|0 ~ 885|885 = 100[%] output|

### <a name="current-limit"></a>**Current Limit (38)**
This value indicates maximum current(torque) output limit. Goal Current(102) can’t be configured with any values exceeding Current Limit(38). The Current Limit(38) is used in Torque Control Mode and Current-based Position Control Mode, therefore decreasing Current Limit(38) will result in decreasing torque of DYNAMIXEL. For more details, please refer to the Position PID Gain(80 ~ 84).

### <a name="shutdown"></a>**Shutdown (63)**
The DYNAMIXEL can protect itself by detecting dangerous situations that could occur during the operation. Each Bit is inclusively processed with the ‘OR’ logic, therefore, multiple options can be generated. For instance, when ‘0x05’ (binary : 00000101) is defined as Shutdown(63), DYNAMIXEL can detect both Input Voltage Error(binary : 00000001) and Overheating Error(binary : 00000100). If those errors are detected, Torque Enable(64) is cleared to ‘0’ and the motor output becomes 0[%]. REBOOT is the only method to reset Torque Enable(64) to ‘1’(Torque ON) after the shutdown. The followings are detectable situations.

|||Definition|Description|
|bit 7|0x80|-|Unused, always ‘0’|
|bit 6|0x40|-|Unused, always ‘0’|
|bit 5|0x20|Overload Error(Default)|Detect persistent load that exceeds maximum output|
|bit 4|0x10|Electrical Shock Error(Default)|Detect electrical shock on the circuit, or input power is insufficient to operate the motor|
|bit 3|0x08|Motor Encoder Error|Detect malfunction of the motor encoder|
|bit 2|0x04|Overheating Error(Default)|Detect internal temperature exceeds the configured operating temperature|
|bit 1|0x02|Motor Hall Sensor Error(Unused)|Unused, always ‘0’|
|bit 0|0x01|Input Voltage Error|Detect input voltage exceeds the configured operating voltage|

{% capture group_notice_02 %}
`Note` If Shutdown occurs, use below method to REBOOT DYNAMIXELs.
1. H/W REBOOT : Turn off the power and turn on again.
2. S/W REBOOT : Transmit REBOOT Instruction (For more details, please refer to the Protocol section of e-Manual).
