# [How to Operate](#how-to-operate)

## [Power Up](#Power Up)
Setting the `POWER` switch to **ON** will turn on the CM-550 controller.  

If the controller does not turn on, the battery might have been depleted. Please refer to [Charging Battery] section to charge the battery, or use 12V SMPS power supply to operate the robot.  
{: .notice}

## [Start](#start)
In order to operate the robot, press the `MODE` button until the button flashes green. While the `MODE` LED is flickering in green, press the `START` button to run the downloaded task code.  

If the `MODE` LED stops flickering after pressing the `START` button, task is running normally.
{: .notice}

## [Quit](#quit)
In order to stop running the task code and exit to standby mode, press the `MODE` button while task is running.

## [Operating Mode](#operating-mode)
The `MODE` button flickers in **Standby Mode**. While the `MODE` LED is flickering, press the `START` button to enter the mode.  
Press the `MODE` button again to exit to Standby Mode.
