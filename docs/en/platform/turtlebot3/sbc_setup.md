# [SBC Setup](#sbc-setup)

**WARNING:** Setup work requires Power and Time. Battery is not suitable. We recommend using SMPS (AC adapter) during this work.

**NOTE:** We are offering three models of TurtleBot3. TurtleBot3 Burger and Waffle Pi use Raspberry Pi 3, and TurtleBot3 Waffle uses Intel Joule 570x. Choose from the following pages according to the SBC used in your model.

## [Raspberry Pi 3](#raspberry-pi-3)

**NOTE:** There are two ways to install Linux and ROS to Raspberry Pi 3. 

- First method: If you prefer Ubuntu MATE, please take the first method [Install Ubuntu MATE](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/raspberry_pi_3_setup/#install-linux-ubuntu-mate) below. This method should install the ROS and dependency packages after installing the Linux images. This instruction takes about 1 hours to install ROS and related packages for TurtleBot3.
- Second method: We provide the Linux distro based on Raspbian. They are pre-installed with ROS and ROS-packages related TurtleBot3. It is available immediately without additional installation. If you want to use it, please take the second method [Install Linux based on Raspbian](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/raspberry_pi_3_setup/#install-linux-based-on-raspbian) below.
