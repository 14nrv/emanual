# [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
Machine learning is a data analysis technique that teaches computers to recognize what is natural for people and animals - learning through experience. There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning.

This application is reinforcement learning with DQN (Deep Q-Learning). The reinforcement learning is concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

This shows reinforcement learning with TurtleBot3 in gazebo.
This reinforcement learning is applied DQN(Deep Q-Learning) algorithm with LDS.  
We are preparing a four-step reinforcement learning tutorial.

## [Installation](#installation)
To do this tutorial, you need to install Tensorflow, Keras and Anaconda with Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS kinetic.

### [Anaconda](#anaconda)
You can download [Anaconda 5.2](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) for Python 2.7 version.

After downloading Andaconda, go to the directory in located download file and enter the follow command.

``` bash
$ bash Anaconda2-x.x.x-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

After installing Anaconda,
``` bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ python -V
```
If Anaconda is installed, you can see `Python 2.7.xx :: Anaconda, Inc.`.

### [ROS dependency packages](#ros-dependency-packages)
To use ROS and Anaconda together, you must additionally install ROS dependency packages.
``` bash
$ pip install -U rosinstall msgpack empy defusedxml netifaces
$ conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge pyqt
$ conda install -c anaconda pyqt=4.11.4
$ pip install pyqtgraph
$ sudo apt-get install python-qt4
```

### [Tensorflow](#tensorflow)
You can install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).  
``` bash
$ conda create -n tensorflow pip python=2.7
```
This tutorial is used python 2.7(CPU only). If you want to use another python version and GPU, please refer to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
``` bash
$ pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.8.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### [Keras](#keras)
[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.

``` bash
$ pip install keras
```

### [Machine Learning packages](#machine-learning-packages)
**WARNING**: Please install [turtlebot3](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3), [turtlebot3_msgs](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs) and [turtlebot3_simulations](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations) package before installing this package.
{: .notice--warning}

``` bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone -b developÂ https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_machine_learning.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

## [Run Machine Learning](#run-machine-learning)
The goal of DQN Agent is to get the TurtleBot3 to the gaol avoiding obstacles. When TurtleBot3 gets closer to the goal, it gets a positive reward, and when it gets farther it gets a negative reward.
The episode ends when the TurtleBot3 crashes on an obstacle or after a certain period of time. During the episode, TurtleBot3 gets a big  positive reward when it gets to the goal, and TurtleBot3 gets a big negative reward when it crashes on an obstacle.

``` bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage_3.launch
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_dqn turtlebot3_dqn_stage_3.launch
```
### [Stage 4 (Combination Obstacle)](#stage-4-combination-obstacle)
Stage 4 is a 5x5 map with walls and two cylinders of moving obstacles.

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/machine_learning/stage_4.jpg)
``` bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage_4.launch
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_dqn turtlebot3_dqn_stage_4.launch
```

If you want to see graph, launch the graph launch file.

``` bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_dqn result_graph.launch
```
