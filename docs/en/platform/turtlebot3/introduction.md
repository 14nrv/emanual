## [TurtleBot3](#turtlebot3)

TurtleBot3 is a new generation mobile robot that is modular, compact and customizable. Let's explore ROS and create exciting applications for education, research and product development.

The goal of TurtleBot3 is to drastically reduce the size and lower the price of the platform without sacrificing capability, functionality, and quality. Optional parts such as chassis, computers and sensors are available, and TurtleBot3 can be customized in various ways. TurtleBot3 is willing to be in the center of the maker movement by applying the latest technical advances of the SBC(Single Board Computer), the Depth sensor and 3D printing technology.

TurtleBot3 is a collaboration project among Open Robotics, ROBOTIS, and more partners like Intel, Onshape, OROCA. The Open Robotics is in charge of software and community activities, while ROBOTIS is in charge of manufacturing and global distribution. We need more partners who can provide technology, educational service or distribution in each country.

## [Features](#features)

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/features_with_icons.png)

### WORLD’S MOST POPULAR ROS PLATFORM

TurtleBot is the most popular open source robot for education and research. The new generation 'TurtleBot3' is a small, low cost, fully programmable, ROS based mobile robot. It is intended to be used for education, research, hobby and product prototyping.

### AFFORDABLE COST

TurtleBot was developed to meet the cost-conscious needs of schools, laboratories and companies. TurtleBot3 is the most affordable robot among the SLAM-able mobile robots equipped with a 360 Laser Distance Sensor LDS-01.

### SMALL SIZE

The dimension of TurtleBot3 Burger is only 138mm x 178mm x 192mm (L x W x H). Its size is about 1/4 of the size of the predecessor. Imagine keeping TurtleBot3 in your backpack and develop your program and test it anywhere you go.

### ROS STANDARD

The TurtleBot brand is managed by [Open Robotics], which develops and maintains ROS. Nowadays, ROS has become the go-to platform for all the roboticists around the world. TurtleBot can be integrated with existing ROS-based robot components, but TurtleBot3 can be an affordable platform for whom want to get started learning ROS.

### EXTENSIBILITY

TurtleBot3 encourages users to customize its mechanical structure with some alternative options: open source embedded board (as a control board), computer and sensors. Turtlebot3 Burger is a two-wheeled differential drive type platform but it is able to be structurally and mechanically customized in many ways: Cars, Bikes, Trailers and so on. Extend your ideas beyond imagination with various SBC, sensors and motors on a scalable structure.

### MODULAR ACTUATOR FOR MOBILE ROBOT

TurtleBot3 is able to get a precise spatial data by using 2 DYNAMIXELs in the wheel joints. DYNAMIXEL XM series can be operated by one of 6 operating modes(XL series: 4 operating modes): Velocity control mode for wheels, Torque control mode or Position control mode for joint, etc. DYNAMIXEL can be used even to make a mobile manipulator which is light but can be precisely controlled with velocity, torque and position control. DYNAMIXEL is a core component that makes TurtleBot3 perfect. It is easy to assemble, maintain, replace and reconfigure.

### OPEN CONTROL BOARD FOR ROS

The control board is open-sourced in hardware wise and in software wise for ROS communication. The open source control board OpenCR1.0 is powerful enough to control not only DYNAMIXELs but also ROBOTIS sensors that are frequently being used for basic recognition tasks in cost effective way. Various sensors such as Touch sensor, Infrared sensor, Color sensor and a handful more are available. The OpenCR1.0 has an IMU sensor inside the board so that it can enhance precise control for countless applications. The board has 3.3V, 5V, 12V power supplies to reinforce the available computer device lineups.

### STRONG SENSOR LINEUPS

TurtleBot3 Burger uses enhanced 360&deg; LiDAR, 9-Axis Inertial Measurement Unit and precise encoder for your research and development. TurtleBot3 Waffle is equipped with an identical 360&deg; LiDAR as well but additionally proposes a powerful Intel® RealSense™ with the recognition SDK. This will be the best hardware solution for making a mobile robot.

### OPEN SOURCE

The hardware, firmware and software of TurtleBot3 are open source which means that users are welcomed to download, modify and share source codes. All components of TurtleBot3 are manufactured with injection molded plastic to achieve low cost, however, the 3D CAD data is also available for 3D printing.
The 3D CAD data is released via Onshape which is a full-cloud 3D CAD editor. Users can get an access with a web browser on desktop PC, laptop and even portable devices. Onshape allows to draw 3D models and to assemble them with colleagues.
Besides, for the users who want to make OpenCR1.0 board by themselves, all details of the OpenCR1.0 board such as schematics, PCB gerber files, BOM and firmware source code are fully opened under the open-source licenses for users and ROS community.
You can modify downloaded source code and hardware to share it with your friends.

## [Basic Operation]

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/opencr_models.png)

You can use `PUSH SW 1` and `PUSH SW 2` buttons to see whether your robot has been properly assembled. This process tests the left and right DYNAMIXELs and the OpenCR1.0 board.

1. After assembling TurtleBot3, connect the battery to OpenCR1.0 and turn on the power switch. You can see that the `Power LED` of OpenCR1.0 turns on.
2. Place the robot on the floor. For the test, safety radius of 1 meter (about 40 inches) is recommended.
3. Press and hold `PUSH SW 1` for a few seconds to command the robot to move 30 centimeters (about 12 inches) forward.
4. Press and hold `PUSH SW 2` for a few seconds to command the robot to rotate 180 degrees in place.

## [Open Source Hardware](#open-source-hardware)

Core components of Turtlebot3 are the followings: Chassis, Motors, Wheels, OpenCR1.0, SBC Computer, Sensor and Battery. The chassis are Waffle Plates that holds other components. The Waffle Plate plays an important role as a chassis although its size is as small as your palm. Waffle plate is manufactured with injection mold method to lower the manufacturing cost. However, the CAD data of waffle plate for 3D printing is also available via [Onshape]. Turtlebot3 Burger is a Two-wheeled differential drive type platform, but it is customizable structurally and mechanically in many ways: Cars, Bikes, Trailers and so on.

The CAD data is released to the [Onshape], which is a full-cloud 3D CAD editor. Get access through a web browser from your PC or from portable devices. OnShape allows drawing and assemblying parts with co-workers.
